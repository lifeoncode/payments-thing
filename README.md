# ðŸ’³ Payments thing

This project is a payments infrastructure API and merchant dashboard with full payment flows (Auth, Capture, Refund, Webhook, Subscription) built using mock data.

Just to manage expectations, I think it's important to point out that this project is pretty large, so depending on when you're seeing this, it might not look like much just yet, but keep in mind that I am working on this whenever I find time.
